This is my most recent side project.

I'm really interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence, so I thought
a pretty fun side project would be to writie a program that analyzes popular novels
that I got off of Project Gutenberg. It's supposed to create two-dimensional vectors
populated with words and the words that follow those words, counts how many times each
word appears and determines which word most commonly follows. The intention is that
this program could eventually formulate a sentence based on Markov Chains.

It's been a great exercise to see how data and functions interact, and I still work on
it from time to time while I'm bored.

In its current state, it populates vectors and can return the words that follow words
like "I'm", "a", "I", "have", etc., but it can't do much else. I haven't quite
finished a working version that adds only one copy of each word and only adds
following words, nor have I finished a word counter.
