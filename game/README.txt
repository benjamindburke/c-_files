These files are simply a side project for when I get bored.

Between school code, work, and outside commitments, I like to code simple stuff that
trains my skills in different ways.

This was my first side project before markov_chains, and I haven't yet abandoned it.

These files in the making represent a text-based game kind of like Zork.

I just thought it would be cool to work with interacting objects and functions
and such.
