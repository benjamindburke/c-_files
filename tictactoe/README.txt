The only file here that was created by me was tic.cpp. Everything else was provided by
the course instructors, but specifications were given on how to implement a game
board. Data type enumeration was provided for us, and our task was to use this new
type to create a board to play Tic-Tac-Toe on. In tic.h, we were given specific
methods to use that could not be deleted (winner(), tBoard(), move(), and game_over())
with no specified private data type. I thought it would be easiest to implement a
two-dimensional symbol array.

How the game was to be played was also determined by the course instructors, so our
main job was to provide all of the backend implementation.
